Logging Module in Python
============================
The logging module is used to record program execution details such as errors, warnings, and informational messages.
It is preferred over print() because it supports log levels, formatting, and file handling.

Log Levels

DEBUG – Detailed diagnostic info

INFO – General messages

WARNING – Potential issues

ERROR – Serious problems

CRITICAL – Program failure

Basic Example
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.info("Program started")
logging.warning("Low memory")
logging.error("An error occurred")

Logging to a File
logging.basicConfig(
    filename="app.log",
    level=logging.ERROR
)
logging.error("File error")

Key Points

Helps in debugging and monitoring

Supports file and console logging

Used in real-world applications
